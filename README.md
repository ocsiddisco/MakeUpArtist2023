I enjoyed working on this portfolio website designed specifically for a makeup artist.
It was build with <b>Next.js</b> and <b>TailwindCSS</b>.

Throughout the website, I have paid careful attention to the layout and presentation. By harnessing the flexibility of <b>flexbox</b>, I have ensured that the content adapts beautifully to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for everyone.

To present makeup looks in the Bridal and Fashion pages, I utilized a <b>grid layout</b>.

While coding this website, I have apply the <b>DRY principle</b>. By organizing my code in a modular and reusable manner, I have minimized redundancy, ensuring that the website remains efficient and easy to maintain.
